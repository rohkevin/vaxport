# Vaxport

### A vaccine passport for travelers in COVID times.
Vaxport is a digital passport in the form of a mobile web app.

With vaccines on the roll-out internationally, traveling is starting open up. The problem is that different countries require different documentations at different checkpoints. 

Vaxport aims to simplify this process into a digital passport that allows one application to act as an official proof of vaccination internationally.

### How will it work?
#### User
The user will be prompted to upload their vaccination records via image once they have registered.

The record image will be sent back to a certified government database where it is checked against their list of vaccinated peoples*

A successful match will indicate to Vaxport that it can generate a QR code for the user. This QR code can be scanned by officials to view the user's vaccination record information such as vaccination date, type, and authorized provider.

#### Official
Vaxport is also set up for official users who can use this app or their QR scanner of choice to scan the user QR codes generated by the app.
