# Vaxport

### A vaccine passport for travelers in COVID times.
Vaxport is a digital passport in the form of a mobile web app.
With vaccines on the roll-out internationally, traveling is starting open up. The problem is that different countries require different documentations at different checkpoints. 
Vaxport aims to simplify this process into a digital passport that allows one application to act as an official proof of vaccination internationally.
